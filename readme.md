This is a backend project I am developing using the chai and code yt channel backend series.

I will be updating the entire running of the project and its entire steps in this readme file

1. creating a folder and then opening it in VS Code. Once opened, the project will be initialized. In the terminal write -
        npm init (this is a command to load the package.json file.Before this command make sure that node is installed using npm i node)

2. Create a readme.md file and mention what all information you want I am mentioning.
